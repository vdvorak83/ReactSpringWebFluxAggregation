Projects

Spring WebFlux Aggregation:
In a Microservice architecture, we will have N number of services and each service has its own responsibilities & databases. Data would have been distributed among them. For ex:

user-service: It is responsible for all the user management.
order-service: It is responsible for managing customerâ€™s orders.

Advantages:
Reduced network calls & latency
Aggregator acts like a facade & hides the backend complexity.

DB
We can use the below docker-compose yaml to expose REST APIs to access above information.
/*
------------------------
version: '3'
services:
server:
image: clue/json-server
ports:
- "3000:80"
  volumes:
- ${PWD}/db.json:/data/db.json
---------------------------------- 
*/
For example, sending below requests to show the corresponding data.
# shows the product 1 information
http://localhost:3000/products/1

# shows the promotion details for product id = 1
http://localhost:3000/promotions/1

# to get all the reviews for product id = 1
http://localhost:3000/reviews?productId=1
